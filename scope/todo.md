- Consolodate ts.exports.update() into ts.update() to reduce boilerplate
- [x] midi.n(f"<c4 c#4 d4 eb4>/{ts.par.Cycle}") should work similar to midi.n(f"<c4 c#4 d4 eb4>", c=ts.par.Cycle) in that value is grabbed after every cycle to refresh speed
- Look into ts.n() and see if .trigger() is explicitly needed to start the pattern or if it auto triggers on compile (similar to strudel). If auto-triggers consider auto_start=True flag, that way users can set it to false then explicitly trigger with .trigger() as well as functions like:
    - .stop() # stops pattern and resets to beginning
    - .pause() # pauses pattern but maintains its position
    - .trigger() # resets to start while continuously playing
